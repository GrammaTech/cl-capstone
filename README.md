CAPSTONE
========

Common Lisp bindings to the Capstone decompiler.
https://github.com/aquynh/capstone

This CAPSTONE library provides raw access to the capstone C API from
Common Lisp.  Its usage to drive `cs-disasm` and `cs-diasm-iter` is
demonstrated in the `cs-disasm-original-example` and
`cs-disasm-iter-original-example` tests in test.lisp.
